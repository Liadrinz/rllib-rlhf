I was wondering if you could walk me through the process of setting up a hydroponic garden for herbs.
I'm looking to buy a car, but I don't know which one to get. Can you help me narrow down the choices.
I'm trying to find a job, but I'm not sure what would be the best for me. Do you have any advice.
Can you help me figure out what books would be best suited to a middle-school age student learning physics.
